add to your homepage a button in the upper right hand corner. when clicked, this button makes visible a menu of user assist options.

- toggle greyscale
- increase/decrease font size

Hint: the #assist-menu should be position:fixed and should start hidden, the only thing the button to active assist menu should do is make the menu visible

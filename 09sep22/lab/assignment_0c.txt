- add a background color to the whole page content
- apply a text-color to all of your header tags
- center the "days meeting" data in your table of classes
- apply an alternating color pattern to the rows of your classes table
- bring your "about me" paragraph next to the picture of your row
- give your "about me" paragraph a border
- set the font in your "about me" paragraph to something pleasing

use only external style sheet(s) or internal <style></style> tags.
NO in-line style=""

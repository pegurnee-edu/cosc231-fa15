- **Distributed:** *November 5rd*

### Description

Implement [Conway's Game of Life][life]. For those of you who are unwilling to follow the link, the Game of Life is 'played' on a board where spaces can be either alive or dead. The rules to determine life status are as follows:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
